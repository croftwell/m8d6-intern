# 3. JavaScript stopPropagation Example

This project demonstrates the use of `stopPropagation()` in JavaScript to prevent event bubbling in the DOM. It provides an example where two nested `div` elements respond to click events, with the inner element stopping the event from propagating to the outer element.

## Features

- **Event Bubbling**: By default, events in JavaScript propagate from the innermost element to the outermost element.
- **stopPropagation()**: This method prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
- **Interactive Example**: Click on the inner or outer `div` to see how `stopPropagation()` works.
